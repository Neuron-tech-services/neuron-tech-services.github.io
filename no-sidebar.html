											<h3>Person Re-Identification in crowd</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Re-identification is the process of associating images or videos of the same person taken from different angles and cameras to retrieve a person of interest.  With the advancement of Deep Neural Networks and the increasing demand for intelligent video surveillance, this problem has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community.</p>
										<p>Person re-ID can be applied in public areas, such as theme parks or campuses, for surveillance and protecting children. For instance, one child is lost in a large park. We have two methods to find him: <li>If he has a GPS device such as cell phone, we can locate him by GPS.</li><li>If he does not carry one, we can use the surveillance cameras around the park/campus to find him. This is what person re-id does</li></p>
										<p>What we need is one photo to conduct image retrieval. (For example, the photo that the child appeared in the square is taken by mum one hour early. Or directly use the park camera records.)</p>

											<h3>Crime scene Detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Crime scene detection in video is one of the long-standing problems in computer vision and has extensive applications in surveillance monitoring, such as detecting illegal activities, traffic accidents and unusual events etc. Millions of surveillance cameras are being deployed in public places worldwide. However, most of the cameras are just passively recording without having any monitoring capability. With petabytes of data generated by the video cameras every minute, it is not possible to understand this large corpus of video data through human effort. We need machine vision to automatically detect anomalies within a video.</p>
												<p>Recognizing of scene in unconstrained videos is extremely hard. The challenges include insufficient annotated data due to the rare occurrence of anomalies, large inter/intra class variations, subjective definition of anomalous events, low resolution of surveillance videos, etc. As humans, we recognize anomalies using our common sense. For example, if multiple people crowd in a street that usually has less traffic, there maybe an anomaly. If violent events such as fighting happen, there maybe an anomaly. For machines, they don’t have common sense but only have visual features.</p>
												<p>In general, the stronger the visual features, the better the anomaly detection performance is expected. In our project, we demonstrate how to obtain strong visual features by incorporating motion information. We observe that features incorporating motion information (C3D and I3D) perform much better than features extracted from individual images (VGG16 and Inception), regardless of network depth and feature dimension.</p>

											<h3>Anomaly Detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Anomaly is something different, abnormal, peculiar, or not easily classified. Surveillance videos can capture a variety of realistic anomalies. One critical task in video surveillance is detecting anomalous events such as traffic accidents, explosions etc. Generally, anomalous events rarely occur as compared to normal activities. Therefore, to alleviate the waste of labour and time, developing intelligent computer vision algorithms for automatic video anomaly detection is a pressing need. The goal of a practical anomaly detection system is to timely signal an activity that deviates normal patterns and identify the time window of the occurring anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection can be considered as coarse level video understanding, which filters out anomalies from normal patterns.</p>
												<p>Real-world anomalous events are complicated and diverse. Therefore, it is desirable that the anomaly detection algorithm does not rely on any prior information about the events. In other words, anomaly detection should be done with minimum supervision. Some of the events detected in our project are:
												<li>Bomb blast</li><li>Automobile Accident</li><li>Earthquake</li><li>Flood</li>
												</p>

											<h3>Action Detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Human action detection is a challenging computer vision problem, which involves detecting human actions in a long video as well as localizing these actions both spatially and temporally. The recent advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown extremely good results for video human action classification, however, action detection is still a challenging problem. The current action detection approaches follow a complex pipeline which involves multiple tasks such as tube proposals, optical flow, and tube classification.</p>
												<p>Traditionally, the task of observing and analysing human activities was carried out by human operators, for example, in security and surveillance processes or the processes of monitoring a patients’ health condition. With the increasing number of camera views and technical monitoring devices, however, this task becomes not only more challenging for the operators but also increasingly cost-intensive since it requests around-the-clock operation.</p>

											<h3>Deepfake</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The advancement in deep learning algorithms in image detection and manipulation has led to the creation of deepfakes, deepfakes use deep learning algorithms to create fake images that are at times very hard to distinguish from real images. Deepfakes (a combination of "deep learning" and "fake") are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. While the act of faking content is not new, deepfakes leverage powerful techniques from artificial intelligence to manipulate or generate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.</p>

											<h3>Data analysis for Stocks</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Data analysis plays a key role in the decisions made by participants in financial markets. Rapid advances in computing high amounts of data from stock exchanges has enabled the design of algorithms, which currently leads a considerable proportion of volume in international stock markets. Stock analysis is a method for investors and traders to make buying and selling decisions. To get the profit of the investing, many investors need to know how to analyse the important data from the stock market. In general, only a few specific guidance appears on the future prediction of market. Therefore, how to predict the stocks from the retrieval data, it becomes an important and considerable problem on market predict.</p>

											<h3>Data Analysis for Gold</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Gold is a familiar valuable metal for investment as compared to silver, platinum, and palladium. Gold has been widely used in many industries not only in the manufacturing of jewellery but also in financing and investing, medical and dentistry, manufacture of electronics, components of computers, and aerospace. In the financing and investing industry, gold is held in the form of gold bullion. Gold bullion is a valuable precious metal that is usually in two main forms: gold bullion bars and gold bullion coins. Nowadays, many institutions are including gold as a major asset of the world’s investment due to their stability which plays an important role in the global economy. Gold is a good investment, neither in the short-term nor the long-term, and it is a great asset that can be converted into paper money.Gold is a familiar valuable metal for investment as compared to silver, platinum, and palladium.

										<p>Gold is one of the oldest and most widely held commodities used as a hedge against the risk of disruptions in financial markets, but gold prices fluctuated substantially over time: slowly and gradually, and this introduces the risk on its own.  The gold prices are influenced by many factors, such as the value of the US dollar, gold production, consumer demand, devaluation of Pakistani currency, and inflation. To disclose the nature of the risks, under extreme situations, and finally, to avoid the risks to the most degree, we need certain risk measures. In addition to the demand and supply of the commodity in the market, the performance of the world’s leading economies also strongly influences gold rates. We predict future gold rates based on 22 market variables using machine learning techniques. Results show that we can predict the daily gold rates very accurately. Our prediction models will be beneficial for investors, and central banks to decide when to invest in this commodity.</p>

											<h3>Data Analysis for Crude oil</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The quantity and quality of statistical data are the cornerstones of macroeconomic model construction, estimation, and forecasting. How much more information can be extracted from economic data has always been a goal worthy of pursuit. As a commodity, crude oil plays an important role in the real economy and the financial market. As a major supplier of energy and raw materials for many industrial materials and agricultural sectors, it has gradually become an investment tool and can even impact the business cycle in the financial market. The price of crude oil dropped by 70% from its peak in the latter half of 2018, which far exceeded the 40% decline in copper, corn, and soybean futures, indicating that oil prices are more volatile. After the financial crisis, the oil price fluctuated and reacted more to external factors. The volatility shock of crude oil price has an important impact on all markets. The measurement and prediction of volatility are also of great significance for asset pricing and risk management, and the price volatility and volatility changes of commodities will also affect the pricing of commodity derivatives and the construction of the optimal hedging ratio. Therefore, the study of fluctuation factors becomes the focus of research.</p>

											<h3>Facial Expression Recognition</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Human facial expressions are extremely essential in social communication. Normally communication involves both verbal and nonverbal. Non-verbal communications are expressed through facial expressions. Face expressions are the delicate signals of the larger communication. Non-verbal communication means communication between humans through eye contact, gesture, facial expressions, body language, and paralanguage. Facial expression recognition plays an important role in communicating the emotions and intentions of human beings. Facial expression recognition in uncontrolled environment is more difficult as compared to that in controlled environment due to change in occlusion, illumination, and noise. Facial expression recognition has emerged as an important research area over the last two decades. Facial expression is one of the immediate, natural, and powerful means for humans to communicate their intentions and emotions. This system can be used in many important applications such as driver safety, health care, video conferencing, virtual reality, and cognitive science etc.</p>

											<h3>Speaker Identification</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Speaker identification is a task of identifying persons from their voices. Speaker’s voice contains personal traits of the speaker, given the unique pronunciation organs and speaking manner of the speaker, e.g., the unique vocal tract shape, larynx size, accent, and rhythm. Therefore, it is possible to identify a speaker from his/her voice automatically via a computer. This technology is termed as automatic speaker recognition.  It has been widely applied to forensics for investigating a suspect to be guilty or non-guilty or surveillance and automatic identity tagging. It is important in audio-based information retrieval for broadcast news, meeting recordings and telephone calls. It can also serve as a frontend of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for improving the transcription performance of multi-speaker conversations.</p>

											<h3>Smart Meter Reader</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Automated meter reading has recently been adopted by utility service providers for improving the reading and billing process. Images captured during meter reading are incorporated in consumer bills to prevent reporting false reading and ensure transparency. Our project aims to automate the existing meter reading system. This method read data from meters using Image processing technique and deep learning model is designed to detect digits in the meter very precisely and give meter reading at the end. The main of this project is create end to end pipeline to detect and recognize multi-digit numbers in various meter topologies using deep learning techniques. To produce an efficient approach for meter reading’s locations and segmentation.</p>
										<p>The user will capture image of meter using mobile and upload it to server. The proposed approach runs and extract the reading of the meter. Then reading will be sent back to the user for confirmation of validity of meter reading and lastly reading will be sent to the server for record keeping.</p>

											<h3>Object Detection in Panorama Images</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Panoramic images are typically represented using an equirectangular projection, which creates severe geometric distortions for objects that are further from the central horizontal line. In this projection, the image space coordinates are usually projected onto a focal plane. Panoramic image can be widely used in many applications, such as virtual reality, visual surveillance, and autonomous vehicle, because of its large field of view. However, the inherent distortion for panorama causes object detection to be a challenging task.</p>
