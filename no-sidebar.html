											<h3>Person Re-Identification in crowd</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Re-identification is the process of associating images or videos of the same person taken from different angles and cameras to retrieve a person of interest.  With the advancement of Deep Neural Networks and the increasing demand for intelligent video surveillance, this problem has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community.</p>
										<p>Person re-ID can be applied in public areas, such as theme parks or campuses, for surveillance and protecting children. For instance, one child is lost in a large park. We have two methods to find him: <li>If he has a GPS device such as cell phone, we can locate him by GPS.</li><li>If he does not carry one, we can use the surveillance cameras around the park/campus to find him. This is what person re-id does</li></p>
										<p>What we need is one photo to conduct image retrieval. (For example, the photo that the child appeared in the square is taken by mum one hour early. Or directly use the park camera records.)</p>

											<h3>Crime scene Detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Crime scene detection in video is one of the long-standing problems in computer vision and has extensive applications in surveillance monitoring, such as detecting illegal activities, traffic accidents and unusual events etc. Millions of surveillance cameras are being deployed in public places worldwide. However, most of the cameras are just passively recording without having any monitoring capability. With petabytes of data generated by the video cameras every minute, it is not possible to understand this large corpus of video data through human effort. We need machine vision to automatically detect anomalies within a video.</p>
												<p>Recognizing of scene in unconstrained videos is extremely hard. The challenges include insufficient annotated data due to the rare occurrence of anomalies, large inter/intra class variations, subjective definition of anomalous events, low resolution of surveillance videos, etc. As humans, we recognize anomalies using our common sense. For example, if multiple people crowd in a street that usually has less traffic, there maybe an anomaly. If violent events such as fighting happen, there maybe an anomaly. For machines, they don’t have common sense but only have visual features.</p>
												<p>In general, the stronger the visual features, the better the anomaly detection performance is expected. In our project, we demonstrate how to obtain strong visual features by incorporating motion information. We observe that features incorporating motion information (C3D and I3D) perform much better than features extracted from individual images (VGG16 and Inception), regardless of network depth and feature dimension.</p>

											<h3>Anomaly Detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Anomaly is something different, abnormal, peculiar, or not easily classified. Surveillance videos can capture a variety of realistic anomalies. One critical task in video surveillance is detecting anomalous events such as traffic accidents, explosions etc. Generally, anomalous events rarely occur as compared to normal activities. Therefore, to alleviate the waste of labour and time, developing intelligent computer vision algorithms for automatic video anomaly detection is a pressing need. The goal of a practical anomaly detection system is to timely signal an activity that deviates normal patterns and identify the time window of the occurring anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection can be considered as coarse level video understanding, which filters out anomalies from normal patterns.</p>
												<p>Real-world anomalous events are complicated and diverse. Therefore, it is desirable that the anomaly detection algorithm does not rely on any prior information about the events. In other words, anomaly detection should be done with minimum supervision. Some of the events detected in our project are:
												<li>Bomb blast</li><li>Automobile Accident</li><li>Earthquake</li><li>Flood</li>
												</p>

											<h3>Action Detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Human action detection is a challenging computer vision problem, which involves detecting human actions in a long video as well as localizing these actions both spatially and temporally. The recent advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown extremely good results for video human action classification, however, action detection is still a challenging problem. The current action detection approaches follow a complex pipeline which involves multiple tasks such as tube proposals, optical flow, and tube classification.</p>
												<p>Traditionally, the task of observing and analysing human activities was carried out by human operators, for example, in security and surveillance processes or the processes of monitoring a patients’ health condition. With the increasing number of camera views and technical monitoring devices, however, this task becomes not only more challenging for the operators but also increasingly cost-intensive since it requests around-the-clock operation.</p>
